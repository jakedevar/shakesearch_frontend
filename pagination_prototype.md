i need to paginate the data which needs to have several things happen for it to be successfull

1. i need to create a page number query that is passed into the SearchBar component along with the quanitity
  a. this is coupled with the fact that when i type a new character the page number needs to be reset
  b. I also need to have a item amount dropdown menu that is present aside from the table this also has it's seperate value and state
2. i need to add these query's to the frontend string that is passed back as well as the backend
  a. backend needs to recognize the query in the search function, this needs to be passed to a pagination function to return the data 
  b. make sure that the types in the search bar are ready for the data as well as making sure set and get for page number and quanitity is respected as params
  c. make sure url is updated for axios request

see reference in backend docs
